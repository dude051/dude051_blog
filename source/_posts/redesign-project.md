I always had big plans for this site, but honestly I felt I never had the appropriate time to maintain it. Recently though, I have rethought this issue and felt that I can use this as a tool to get more of my thoughts down to help me collect them. The result would also be a place people might learn a thing or two from, which would be great - all of us learn something together, right?

My first official re-launch post will be about me moving to a new site platform. I decided to go with the new hotness, something I personally have never worked on a project with.

# Enter Hexo:

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

Hexo is for NodeJS what [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) did for Ruby. As the site details, it is "A fast, simple & powerful blog framework". And dead simple and fast it is, I had this new site up in about 5 minutes, and I was writing post within the hour. Honestly, the longest potion of my work came from trying to make heads of tails of the system and its theming. I hope to grow this knowledge more and post as I learn more about Hexo itself.

# Next Steps:
My next post will detail how I took a minimalistic approach to integration and deployment pipelines for this site using Rackspace Cloud Files as an object storage to serve static content.
